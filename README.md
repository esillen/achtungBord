# achtungBord
The code for the achtung table (achtungbordet)

## Instructions
This will run on python 2.7 with pygame 1.9.1
If you just want to run the game to try it, simply run actungMain.py
If you want to run the game as inteded on raspberry pi, change the inputModule.py in the main folder to the one in the folder rpi_inputmodule.
Do the necessary wiring. The code in inputModule.py should be straight-forward and should help you do the wiring correctly.

## Sorry
There is a lot of swedish mixed in the code. And some code is downright shite. I wrote this a long time ago before I knew better. 

## TODO: 
- implement better collision detection (for instance extra collision points on the side of le schnake)
